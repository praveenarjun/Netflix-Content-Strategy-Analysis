3. Key Findings & Business Insights
Strategic Shift to TV Shows: The analysis reveals a clear strategic pivot from Movies to TV Shows in recent years, a move likely intended to increase subscriber retention through binge-worthy content.

Core Brand Genres Identified: "International Movies," "Dramas," and "Comedies" are the most heavily-stocked genres, forming the core of the Netflix brand identity.

Global Content Strategy Validated: The data confirms the success of Netflix's global strategy, with the USA and India emerging as the top content sources, proving the model of producing local content for a global audience.

Dual Content-Freshness Strategy: Netflix employs a dual strategy: a focus on "Originals" to attract new subscribers, balanced with licensing a deep library of "classic" content to retain existing users.

Primary Target Audience Confirmed: The dominance of TV-MA and TV-14 ratings confirms that Netflix's primary target audience is adults and older teens.
